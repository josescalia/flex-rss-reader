This project is a Rss Reader application project using Adobe Flex Air as it's interface.
The main idea of this project is my first project using Adobe Flex.
I've updated the installer which is ready to download. The latest release of this application was no longer need Server Side Application to run. So what you need is only install the application and enjoy it.
Please select the download-able file which have a label as "Last Updated Version". That's the only installer file you only have to download. No Others file needed for this latest release.
I'm still working out for the manual help of this application, a few lines need to be added to make the user fully understand of how to find out the RSS Feed from a websites..
